The <noun> spoke to him, its voice echoing through the chamber. "Brave squirrel, you have awakened me. I grant you three wishes. Choose wisely."

The <noun> glowed brightly, and Sylvester felt a sense of calm wash over him. From that day on, the forest flourished, and animals of all kinds lived together in harmony.
